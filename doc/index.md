# IPFS Engine

A .Net implementation of IPFS. 
The source code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/richardschneider/net-dns) and the 
package is published on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Makaretu.Dns).

The interplanetary file system is the permanent web. It is a new hypermedia distribution protocol, addressed by content and identities. IPFS enables the creation of completely distributed applications. It aims to make the web faster, safer, and more open.

- [Articles](articles/intro.md) on using the DNS model
- [DNS Documentation](api/Makaretu.Dns.yml) describes the data model in detail
